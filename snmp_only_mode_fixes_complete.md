# SNMP-Only Mode Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Total Processors Sensor** ✅
- **Problem**: Showed as unavailable in SNMP-only mode
- **Solution**: Added fallback logic to count CPU temperature sensors
- **How it works**: Extracts CPU numbers from sensor names like "CPU1 Temp", "CPU2 Temp"

### 2. **Chassis Intrusion Detection Inverted** ✅
- **Problem**: Sensor was using "reading" field which had inverted logic
- **Solution**: Changed to use "status" field which has correct mapping
- **Mapping**: 1=breach, 2=no_breach, 3=ok, 4=unknown

### 3. **Duplicate Intrusion Sensors** ✅
- **Problem**: Both "Chassis Intrusion Detection" and "System Board Intrusion Detection" were created
- **Solution**: Skip creating aggregated sensor when individual SNMP intrusion sensors exist
- **Result**: Only individual "System Board Intrusion Detection" sensors appear in SNMP-only mode

### 4. **Memory Status and Processor Status** ✅
- **Problem**: Both showed as unavailable in SNMP-only mode
- **Solution**: Added fallback logic to aggregate status from individual sensors
- **Logic**: 
  - If any sensor shows Critical (1) → "Critical"
  - Else if any shows Warning (2) → "Warning" 
  - Else if all show OK (3) → "OK"
  - Otherwise → "Unknown"

## Testing Checklist

After restarting Home Assistant with these fixes:

- [ ] **Total Processors** should show the CPU count (e.g., "2")
- [ ] **System Board Intrusion Detection** should show correct state (not inverted)
- [ ] **Chassis Intrusion Detection** should NOT appear (no duplicate)
- [ ] **Memory Status** should show aggregated status (e.g., "OK")
- [ ] **Processor Status** should show aggregated status (e.g., "OK")

## Code Changes Summary

1. **sensor.py**:
   - `IdracProcessorCountSensor`: Added CPU temperature counting fallback
   - `IdracProcessorStatusSensor`: Added status aggregation from processors data
   - `IdracMemoryStatusSensor`: Added status aggregation from memory data

2. **binary_sensor.py**:
   - `IdracSystemIntrusionBinarySensor`: Fixed to use "status" field instead of "reading"
   - Setup logic: Skip creating aggregated sensor when individual SNMP sensors exist

## SNMP-Only Mode Benefits

With these fixes, SNMP-only mode now provides:
- ✅ 46+ sensors for comprehensive monitoring
- ✅ Support for legacy iDRACs (iDRAC6, iDRAC7, iDRAC8)
- ✅ Fast 15-second update intervals
- ✅ Proper status aggregation for system health
- ✅ No duplicate sensors
- ✅ Correct intrusion detection state
