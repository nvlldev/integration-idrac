# Chassis Intrusion Sensor - Next Steps

## Current Status

The chassis intrusion binary sensor has been fixed to:
✅ Always return `bool` instead of `bool | None` 
✅ Provide chassis intrusion data from Redfish coordinator
✅ Handle "Unknown" status gracefully (return False)
✅ Remove debug logging that was cluttering logs

## Log Analysis

From your logs:
```
2025-06-27 19:03:03.944 DEBUG Finished fetching idrac data in 14.053 seconds (success: True)
2025-06-27 19:03:03.952 DEBUG Chassis intrusion data: {'status': 'Unknown', 'sensor_number': None, 're_arm': None}
2025-06-27 19:03:03.953 DEBUG Chassis intrusion status: Unknown
```

This shows:
- ✅ Coordinator successfully fetched data
- ✅ Chassis intrusion data is available with expected structure
- ✅ Status is "Unknown" as expected from test results

## Likely Issue: Home Assistant State Caching

The sensor may still show "Unavailable" due to Home Assistant caching the previous state. This is common when fixing sensor availability issues.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Reload Integration (Quick)
1. Go to **Developer Tools** → **YAML**
2. Click **Reload All** or **Restart**
3. Check if chassis intrusion sensor now shows "Normal" (Off)

### Option 2: Restart Home Assistant (Recommended)
1. **Settings** → **System** → **Restart**
2. Wait for restart to complete
3. Check integration page for sensor status

### Option 3: Delete Entity (If Still Stuck)
If the entity is permanently stuck:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities**
2. Search for "chassis intrusion"
3. Delete the stuck entity
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Entity should be automatically recreated with correct status

## Expected Results After Restart

**Before Fix:**
- Chassis Intrusion: ❌ **Unavailable**

**After Fix:**
- Chassis Intrusion: ✅ **Normal** (Off)
- Status: Available and functional
- Value: False (no intrusion detected)

## Verification

Once working, you should see:
1. ✅ Sensor appears in Diagnostic section
2. ✅ Shows "Normal" or "Off" state  
3. ✅ Has proper device association
4. ✅ No more "unavailable" in logs

## If Still Not Working

If the sensor still shows unavailable after restart:
1. Check Home Assistant logs for new errors
2. Verify integration is using Redfish mode (not SNMP/hybrid)
3. Consider deleting and re-adding the integration entry

The technical fix is complete - this is now likely a Home Assistant state caching issue that requires a restart or reload to resolve.
